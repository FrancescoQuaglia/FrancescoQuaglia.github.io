<p> The examination requires fulfilling the developement of a Linux kernel subsystem compliant with the following specification: 

</p><h3>
Project - Linux Mail slots 
</h3>
This specification related the implementation of a special device file 
that is accessible according to FIFO style semantic (via 
open/close/read/write services), but offering an execution semantic of 
read/write services such that any segment that is posted to the stream 
associated with the file is seen as an independent data unit (a 
message), thus being posted and delivered atomically (all or nothing) 
and in data separation (with respect to other segments) to the reading 
threads.
 
<p>The device file needs to be multi-instance (by having the possibility
 to manage at least 256 different instances) so that mutiple FIFO style 
streams (characterized by the above semantic) can be concurrently 
accessed by active processes/threads.

</p><p>The device file needs to also support ioctl commands in order to 
define the run time behavior of any I/O session targeting it (such as 
whether read and/or write operations on a session need to be performed 
according to blocking or non-blocking rules). 

</p><p>Parameters that are left to the designer, which should be selected via reasonable policies, are:
</p><ul>
<li> the maximum size of managed data-units (this might also be made tunable via ioctl up to an absolute upper limit) 
</li><li> the maximum storage that can be (dynamically) reserved for any individual mail slot 
</li><li> the range of device file minor numbers supported by the driver (it could be the interval [0-255] or not)
</li></ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> this project deals with implementing within Linux 
services similar to those that are offered by Windows "mail slots", 
which is the reason for the selected project name
