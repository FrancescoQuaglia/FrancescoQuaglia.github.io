Course objectives and examination rules
</h3>

<p> Some time ago a friend of mine told me the following ".... parallel programming is for a few, 
kernel programming is for a few of them ....". In the end I fully agreed upon this concept, definitely
 supporting the idea that the deepest approach to the explanation of parallelism and concurrency is one based on both user and kernel space operations. This is the reason why this course on multi/many-core programming, beyond presenting concepts on the relation between hardware parallelims vs software design, is also focused on kernel level software.
<p>
Parallelism in the hardware---either implicit or explicit---will be analyzed by the side of its impact on advanced 
design/implementation methods and techniques for modern system/kernel level software. The topics dealt with by the course are bound to case 
studies oriented to x86 compliant processors and LINUX systems. In any case they can be easily transposed to other hardware/software systems. The course requires basic knowledge on computer architecture, on the structure and functionalities of operating systems, and knowledge on C/ASM programming. 
<p> The lecture flow will be based on presenting concepts in combination with running examples. Both the slides and the software examples will be made available while delivering the course, 
 clearly in advance to discussing them at any lecture. The slides as well as the software examples can be accessed and downloaded from links posted in the last section of this Web page
<p>
The examination consists of a set of questions and additionally requires the development of software sub-systems (a project) to be embedded within the LINUX kernel, 
whose specification for the academic year 2017/2018 will be posted during the course delivery. Each student is supposed to finalize both these parts of the examination within the same accademic year. The delivery of sofwtare project does not need to coincide with the scheduled examination dates. Rather, students can deliver their projects at any student reception (see <a href="../../teaching.html">this link</a>).

IMPORTANT NOTICE
</h3>
<p>Even though the above references and links are provided, I must alert students that no unique 
hand-book can fully cover the presented topics (and/or the way of presenting them). Hope this will be an added value to the course, rather than a limitation. Please come to any available student reception as soon as any doubt, or the need for whathever clarification, arises.
