<p> The examination requires fulfilling the developement of a Linux kernel subsystem compliant with the following specification: 

</p><h3>
Sessioned file access 
</h3>
This specification is related to the implementation of a device  
driver that allows sessioned file access for files that are
kept in a specific directory within the VFS tree.
The pathname of this directory is a parameter of the device driver.
Lets' suppose that this pathname is dir-A, then for any file F in dir-A
the driver enables creating a sessioned file F in another directory whose pathname will be
dir-B. This pathname can be selected by the sofwtare designer.

The device driver need to suppor creation and removal of sessiond files with arbitrary names in/from dir-B.

When a sessioned file F in dir-B is opened,  a new incarnation of this file is created and its content needs to be atomically filled with the one of the corresponding file F in dir-A. However,  
its update operations must not be immediately visible on the corresponding file F in dir-A (or on other files).
These updates must be atomically flushed to F in dir-A only upon the closure of an I/O session on the sessioned file F residing in dir-B. In other words, all the operations on the sessioned file remain volatile up to its closure.
If upon such closure, the  the corresponding file F in dir-A no longer exists, then the closing process must 
receive the SIGPIPE signal.

Sessioned files in dir-B must support at least the following set of file-operations:
<ul>
<li>open
<li> close
<li>read
<li>write
<li>lseek

Volatile i-nodes are allowed for sessioned files in dir-B, so that they can be eliminated when umounting the file-system 
they belong to.
Also, for simplicity of the design, we can assume that the maximum size of a file F in dir-A to be accessed via the correspodning sessioned file F in dir-B does not exceed the maximum storage size garanteed by a single buddy-system allocation operation on the specific version of the Linux kernel where the device driver is nested.

Concurrent I/O sessions on files in dir-B must be allowed, as well as concurrent operations on a same I/O session, as usual for files in Linux. On the other hand, atomicity of the concurrent operations must still be guaranteed.
