<h3>
	<A NAME="TLS"><b>Alternative Thread Local Storage (TLS)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a TLS support standing aside of the original one offered by gcc. It should be based on a few macros with the following meaning:

<ul>
	<li>PER_THREAD_MEMORY_START and PER_THREAD_MEMORY_END are used to delimitate the variable declarations that 
will be part of TLS

<li>READ_THREAD_VARIABLE(name) is used to return the value of a TLS variable with a given name

	<li>WRITE_THREAD_VARIABLE(name, value) is used to update the TLS variable with a given name to a given value
</ul><p> Essentially, the homework is tailored to implement an interface for managing per-thread memory resembling the one offered by the Linux kernel for managing per-CPU memory.
