<h3>
	<A NAME="TLS"><b>Alternative Thread Local Storage (TLS)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a TLS support standing aside of the original one offered by gcc. It should be based on a few macros with the following meaning:

<ul>
	<li>PER_THREAD_MEMORY_START and PER_THREAD_MEMORY_END are used to delimitate the variable declarations that 
will be part of TLS

<li>READ_THREAD_VARIABLE(name) is used to return the value of a TLS variable with a given name

	<li>WRITE_THREAD_VARIABLE(name, value) is used to update the TLS variable with a given name to a given value
</ul><p> Essentially, the homework is tailored to implement an interface for managing per-thread memory resembling the one offered by the Linux kernel for managing per-CPU memory.

<h3>
	<A NAME="SCTD"><b>Sys Call Table Discovery (SCTD)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linuk kernel module that discovers at run-time the positioning of the system-call table. The simplifying assumption is that the module programmer can exploit the kernel-side name of some system-call (hence the corresponding
	actual address) in order to perform the discovery phase. The module should provide the current memory address of the system-call table via a kernel level message accessible via the 'dmesg' shell command.

<h3>
	<A NAME="VTPMO"><b>Virtual to Physical Memory Mapping Oracle (VTPMO)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linuk kernel module that offers 
	a service accessible via a specific system-call, which can provide information on the 
	current mapping of logical addresses to physical memory. The service will receive a virtual address as input parameter and will return the number of the frame that maps the corresponding virtual page to physical memory. If no mapping currently exists, the service should return an error value. The service should be able to cope with both regular and huge-page memory mappings.
