<p><b> Title </b>

<p>Bridging the gap between transactional memory and two emerging hardware technologies: non-volatile memories and heterogeneous computing architectures.

<p><b> Abstract </b>


<p>Transactional Memory (TM) is a simple, yet powerful, synchronization abstraction for concurrent programming, whose popularity has grown largely over the last years: nowadays, hardware supports for TM are provided in commodity CPUs (e.g., by Intel and IBM) and, at the software level, TM has been integrated in mainstream programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java.

In this talk I will present the novel challenges and research opportunities that arise in the area of TM due to the emergence of two recent hardware trends, namely Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and heterogeneous computing architectures.

On the front of NVM, I will present NV-HTM [1], a system that allows the execution of transactions over NVM using unmodified commodity hardware TM (HTM) implementations. NV-HTM exploits a hardware-software co-design approach that exploits two key novel ideas: i) relying on software to persist transactional modifications after they have been committed via HTM; ii) asynchronous checkpointing schemes that  not only bound the log space and recovery time, but also implement wear leveling techniques to enhance NVM's endurance. As I will show, NV-HTM can achieve up to 10x speed-ups and up to 11.6x reduced flush operations with respect to state of the art solutions, which, unlike NV-HTM, require custom modifications to existing HTM systems.

On the front of heterogeneous computing, I will present the abstraction of Heterogeneous Transactional Memory (HeTM) [2]. HeTM provides programmers with the illusion of a single memory
region, shared among the CPUs and the (discrete) GPU(s) of a heterogeneous system, with support for atomic transactions. Besides introducing the abstract semantics and programming
model of HeTM, I will present the design and evaluation of a concrete implementation of the proposed abstraction, which we named Speculative HeTM (SHeTM). SHeTM makes use of a novel
design that leverages speculative techniques that aim at hiding the large communication latency between CPUs and discrete GPUs and at minimizing inter-device synchronization
overhead.
