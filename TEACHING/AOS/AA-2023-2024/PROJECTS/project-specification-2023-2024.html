<p> The examination requires fulfilling the development of a project in the Linux kernel, which must comply with the following specification. Each student should develop the project individually.

</p><h3>
Kernel Level Reference Monitor for File Protection  
</h3>
This specification is related to a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) implementing a reference monitor for file protection. 

The reference monitor can be in one of the following four states:

<ul>
<li> OFF, meaning that its operations are currently disabled;
<li> ON, meaning that its operations are currently enabled; 
<li> REC-ON/REC-OFF, meaning that it can be currently reconfigured (in either ON or OFF mode). 
</ul>

<p>The configuration of the reference monitor is based on a set of file system paths. Each path corresponds to a file/dir that cannot be currently opened in write mode. Hence, any attempt to write-open the path needs to return an error, independently of the user-id that attempts the open operation.

<p> Reconfiguring the reference monitor means that some path to be protected can be added/removed. In any case, changing the current state of the reference monitor requires that the thread that is running this operation needs to be marked with effective-user-id set to root, and additionally the reconfiguration requires in input a password that is reference-monitor specific. This means that the encrypted version of the password is maintained at the level of the reference monitor architecture for performing the required checks.

<p>It is up to the software designer to determine if the above states ON/OFF/REC-ON/REC-OFF can be changed via VFS API or via specific system-calls. The same is true for the services that implement each reconfiguration step (addition/deletion of paths to be checked). Together with kernel level stuff, the project should also deliver user space code/commands for invoking the system level API with correct parameters.

<p>In addition to the above specifics, the project should also include the realization of a file system where a single append-only file should record the following tuple of data (per line of the file) each time an attempt to write-open a protected file system path is attempted:


<ul>
	<li>the process TGID
	<li>the thread ID
	<li>the user-id
	<li>the effective user-id
	<li>the program path-name that is currently attempting the open
	<li> a cryptographic hash of the program file content
		
</ul>
		
The the computation of the cryptographic hash and the writing of the above tuple should be carried in deferred work.
