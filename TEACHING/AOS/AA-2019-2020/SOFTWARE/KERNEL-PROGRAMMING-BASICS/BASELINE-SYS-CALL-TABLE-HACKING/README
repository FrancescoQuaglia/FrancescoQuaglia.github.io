=============================================================================
README FILE for the sys-call-table-hacker.c kernel module

please compile the module with 'make'

then mount the module with 'insmod sys-call-table-hacker.ko' - this needs sudo privilege

VERY IMPORTANT: the module relies on 2 symbols from the kernel system map:

1) sys_call_table (and the corresponding address)
2) sys_ni_syscall (and the corresponding address)

if the two are not set correctly into the source code of sys-call-table-hacker.c (preamble part) 
your system will likely crash or freeze upon mounting the module

the same is true if kaslr is active

once the module is correctly installed, you can inspect via dmesg the modifications to the original sys-call-table
so to identify the numerical codes that have been associated with the two added system-calls, namely 
sys_my_first_syscall and sys_my_second_syscall
