README FILE for the reference_monitor.c kernel module

please compile the module with 'make'

then mount the module with 'insmod reference_monitor.ko' - this needs sudo privilege

VERY IMPORTANT: the module relies on 2 symbols from the kernel system map:

1) execve_stub (and the corresponding address)
2) the next symbol to execve_stub (and the corresponding address) - this is referred to as next_symbol in the module
	

if the two symbols are not set correctly into the source code of reference_monitor.c (preamble part) 
your system will likely crash or freeze upon mounting the module

you also need to set a function pointer called sys_execve to the address of the corresponding kernel level function

the current settings of these symbols is for kernel 
3.16.7-7-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Dec 17 18:00:44 UTC 2014 (762f27a) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

once the module is mounted, the root user is restricted in terms of priviledges according to the blacklist of executables that root is not allowed to exec

the module is not unmountable - you need system reboot for restoring the original kernel image
