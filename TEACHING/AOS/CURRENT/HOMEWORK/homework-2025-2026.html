<h3>
        <A NAME="TLS"><b>Alternative Thread Local Storage (TLS)</b></a>
</h3>

        <p>This homework deals with the implementation of a TLS support standing aside of the original one offered by gcc. It should be based on a few macros with the following meaning:

<ul>
        <li>PER_THREAD_MEMORY_START and PER_THREAD_MEMORY_END are used to delimitate the variable declarations that will be part of TLS

<li>READ_THREAD_VARIABLE(name) is used to return the value of a TLS variable with a given name

        <li>WRITE_THREAD_VARIABLE(name, value) is used to update the TLS variable with a given name to a given value
</ul><p> Essentially, the homework is tailored to implementing an interface for managing per-thread memory resembling the one offered by the Linux kernel for managing per-CPU memory.

<h3>
        <A NAME="QUEUING"><b>Blocking Queuing Service (BQS)</b></a>
</h3>

<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel subsystem dealing with thread management. The subsystem should implement a blocking FIFO-queuing service. It is based on two system calls 1) <tt> int goto_sleep(void) </tt> used to make a thread sleep at the tail of the queue and 2) <tt> int awake(void)</tt> used to awake the thread currently standing at the head of the queue. Threads could also be awaken in non-FIFO order because of Posix signals.
