<p> This page is used to post suggested homework which can help better making experience with the course topics. The suggested homework is not mandatory for passing the examination. 
For each suggested homework a solution will be posted along with the "Software Examples" available via the course main page. Students are encouraged to provide their own solutions before checking with the posted one.

<h3>
	<A NAME="RCUL"><b>RCU List (RCUL)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the C-based implementation of an RCU (Read Copy Update) list offering the following API:

<ul>
	<li> int rcu_list_insert(rcu_list *l, long key) to insert into the RCU list a given key (an integer value);
	<li> int rcu_list_search(rcu_list *l, long key) to check if the key is currently present within an element of  the RCU list;

<li> int rcu_list_remove(rcu_list *l, long key) to remove a record containing the target key from the RCU list.

</ul>

<p> Atomic memory operations via gcc bult-in API like, e.g., __sync_fetch_and_add(...), can be used as building blocks.
Each function should return zero upon success.

<h3>
	<A NAME="TLS"><b>Alternative Thread Local Storage (TLS)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a TLS support standing aside of the original one offered by gcc. It should be based on a few macros with the following meaning:

<ul>
	<li>PER_THREAD_MEMORY_START and PER_THREAD_MEMORY_END are used to delimitate the variable declarations that will be part of TLS

<li>READ_THREAD_VARIABLE(name) is used to return the value of a TLS variable with a given name

	<li>WRITE_THREAD_VARIABLE(name, value) is used to update the TLS variable with a given name to a given value
</ul><p> Essentially, the homework is tailored to implementing an interface for managing per-thread memory resembling the one offered by the Linux kernel for managing per-CPU memory.

<h3>
	<A NAME="VTPMO"><b>Virtual to Physical Mapping Oracle (VTPMO)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a system-call <tt>int vtpmo(unsigned long x)</tt> dealing with memory management. This system call should take as input parameter a user-level logical address and should return to the user information related to the frame-number that hosts the virtual page (or huge page) associated with that address. Invalid addresses (e.g. kernel level addresses) should be correctly identified by the system call, which will simply return an error code in this case.

<h3>
	<A NAME="QUEUING"><b>Blocking Queuing Service (BQS)</b></a>
</h3>

<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel subsystem dealing with thread management. The subsystem should implement a blocking FIFO-queuing service. It is based on two system calls 1) <tt> int goto_sleep(void) </tt> used to make a thread sleep at the tail of the queue and 2) <tt> int awake(void)</tt> used to awake the thread currently standing at the head of the queue. Threads could also be awaken in non-FIFO order because of Posix signals.

<h3>
	<A NAME="PC"><b>Process Controller (PC)</b></a>
</h3>

<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel module that offers a device file
which allows updating the content of memory locations in the address space of an arbitrary process. The device file must support a write
operation that leads to update the content of some memory location (supposed to be of type long) 
in the address space of the target process.
To be successful, the write operation needs to receive as input-stream a sequence of bytes structured as follows: "PID ADDRESS NEW_VALUE", where PID is the target process identifier, ADDRESS is the memory address where the update 
needs to be installed and NEW_VALUE is the value to be installed on that memory location.

<h3>
	<A NAME="VTPMO"><b>Virtual to Physical Memory Mapping Oracle (VTPMO)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel module that offers 
	a service accessible via a specific system-call, which can provide information on the 
	current mapping of logical addresses to physical memory. The service will receive a virtual address as input parameter and will return the number of the frame that maps the corresponding virtual page to physical memory. If no mapping currently exists, the service should return an error value. The service should be able to cope with both regular and huge-page memory mappings.

<h3>
	<A NAME="NICRCUM"><b>No Intermediate Copy RCU Messaging (NICRCUM)</b></a>
</h3>

	<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel module that offers 
	a service accessible via specific system-calls for posting a message to the kernel and retrieving the current content of the message. A new post invalidates the content of the last posted message.
The service should guarantee no intermediate copy of the message content between user and kernel level buffers (just one copy is admitted) and should also guarantee RCU synchronization across threads.	
<hr>


<h3>
	<A NAME="MSS"><b>Micro-sleep Service (MSS)</b></a>
</h3>

<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel module that offers a new system call
which implements a thread sleep service at microsecond granularity. Essentially the new system call has an execution semantic equivalent to the classical usleep() Posix service. The requirement is that the precision according to which the sleep-timeout
provided by the calling thread is matched upon thread awake should be at least the same as the one of the native usleep() service.
The user program at  <a href="../SOFTWARE/usleep-test.c">this link</a> can be used in order to determine if the actual precision of the
implemented sleep service is comparable with the one of usleep(). The solution should NOT rely on a wait-event-queue 
API that offers the possibility to set hr-timeouts, so hr-timers should be used explicitly.

<h3>
	<A NAME="TI"><b>Trap Installer (TI)</b></a>
</h3>

<p>This homework deals with the implementation of a Linux kernel module that offers a new trap. 
The new trap is a simple stub that can in turn pass control to a kernel function coded with a classical C-based
interface. To find a free entry in the IDT table where to install the new trap either a search can be
performed by exploiting the free_vectors symbol (this identifies a bitmap that can be accesses/modified with the test_bit(n,bitmap)/set_bit(n,bitmap) API) if available for module programming on the specific kernel version, or the entry 
at displacement 255 can be overwritten (which is typically devoted to spurious interrupts). To manipulate the IDTR 
the kernel API functions load_idt() and store_idt() can be exploited. Also, the notation ".globl NAME" can be exploited in a asm code block to make any label defined in the code block visible to the compiler via a corresponding function associated with NAME.  Recall that an IDT entry is a "struct desc_struct". Finally, the exemplifying assumption can be made that the kernel starts with the PTI=off option (KAISER is switched off).

which allows updating the content of memory locations in the address space of an arbitrary process. The device file must support a write
operation that leads to update the content of some memory location (supposed to be of type long) 
in the address space of the target process.
To be successful, the write operation needs to receive as input-stream a sequence of bytes structured as follows: "PID ADDRESS NEW_VALUE", where PID is the target process identifier, ADDRESS is the memory address where the update 
needs to be installed and NEW_VALUE is the value to be installed on that memory location.
