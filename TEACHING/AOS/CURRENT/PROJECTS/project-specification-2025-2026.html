<p>The examination requires fulfilling the development of a project in the Linux kernel, which must comply with the following specification. Each student should develop the project individually. 

    <h3>Project specification: syscall throttling</h3>


    <p>
This specification is related to a Linux Kernel Module (LKM) implementing a system call throttling mechanism. 
The LKM should offer a device driver for supporting the registration/deregistration of:

<ul>
<li> program names (executable names)
<li> user IDs
<li> syscall numbers (according to x86-64 specification)
</ul>

Such registration can be supported via the <tt>ioctl(...)</tt> system call.

The registered syscall numbers are used to indicate that the corresponding systen calls can be critical for various aspects, like scalability, performance or security. 

<p>Each time one of the registered syscall is invoked by a program that is registered by the device driver or by a user (effective user-ID) that is registered by the device driver, the real execution of the system call needs to be controlled by a <b>monitor</b> offered by the LKM.

<p>In particular, the LKM monitor can be configured to indicate what is the maximum number MAX of registered syscalls that can be actually invoked in a wall-clock-time window of 1 second by the registered program-names/user-IDs.  If the actual volume of invocations per wall-clock-time unit exceeds MAX, then the invoking threads need to be temporarily blocked, thus preventing their actual syscall invocation.

<p> The syscalls managed by the LKM can be of whathever nature. Hence they can be either blocking or non-blocking.

<p>The device driver also needs to offer the possibility to verify at each time instant what are the registered program names, user-IDs and syscall numbers. Also, the update of such information can be only carried out by a thread which is running with effective user-ID set to the value 0 (root).

<p>Also, the device driver needs to support the possibility to turn the syscall monitor off/on along time. If it is turned off, no limit on the frequencey of registered syscalls ivocations per wall-clock-time unit gets applied. Additionally, on the basis of the selected value for MAX, the device driver should also provide data related to:

<ul>
<li> The peak delay for the actual execution of an invoked system call, and the corresponding program-name and user-ID
<li> The average and peak numbers of threads that had to be blocked 
</ul>

<p> It is expected that the user level code for configuring the LKM monitor, and for testing the correct behavior of the developed LKM software is delivered as part of the project.

<h3>Project delivery</h3>
Projects can be delivered (for analysis and discussion) at any scheduled tutoring slot
