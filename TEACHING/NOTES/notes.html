<h3> A few words about what I think of teaching</h3>
<body>  


<hr>
It is passion, and is very fine technique, which can continuously take benefits from research and from field experience. 
<p>It is also a matter of learning from students if each single word you are using (and  each single sign on the board you are doing) is really right. 
This is why I thank all the students I have had for always pushing me to improve the way I hold classes and for making me aware that something better can always be done. 
<p>I'm particularly honored for the optional posts a few of them left on the <a href="https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~quaglia/cgi-bin/deliver.pl?target=https://francescoquaglia.github.io/TEACHING/NOTES/AOSV-2016-2017.pdf" >official evaluation sheet of my very last "Advanced Operating Systems and Virtualization" course (MS Degree in Computer Engineering - 2016/2017) held at La Sapienza University</a> .......
<p>..... and for those they left on the <a href="https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~quaglia/cgi-bin/deliver.pl?target=https://francescoquaglia.github.io/TEACHING/NOTES/SO-2017-2018.pdf">official evaluation sheet of my very first "Operating Systems" course (BS Degree in Computer Engineering - 2017/2018) held at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata"</a>.
